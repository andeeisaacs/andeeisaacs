### Hello! Hola! Hi! Greetings! 

I'm **Andee Isaacs**, Software Enginer, 3D printing business owner, LLM enthusiast, general tech tinkerer and former instructor and alumni of  **[LEARN Academy](https://www.learnacademy.org/)**. I enjoy realy good coffee and the rediculously good weather of San Diego, CA. 

When I'm not working on tech, I'm usually prepping DM work for one of my DnD campaigns.

I'm most proficient with: 
- React / Next / Gatsby / Javascript
- ThemeUi / TailWind
- Ruby
- Misc: Building API's, helpers, hooks and NPM packages (Mostly just helper tools).

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, want to chat about code/tech, meetups, games (video or board), french bulldogs, exchange advice on being a parent or just would like to grab a drink or two in San Diego!
