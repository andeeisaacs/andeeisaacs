### Hello! Hola! Hi! Greetings! 

I'm **Andee Isaacs**, a Software Engineer at **[Pack Digital](https://packdigital.com/)**, former instructor and alumni of  **[LEARN Academy](https://www.learnacademy.org/)**. I enjoy realy good coffee and the rediculously good weather of San Diego, CA. 

Currently working on building headless ecommerce storefronts! 

I'm most proficient with: 
- React / Next / Gatsby
- ThemeUi / TailWind
- Misc: Building API's, helpers, hooks and NPM packages that really only serve a single purpose for assisting me with my day to day coding work! 

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, want to chat about code/tech, meetups, games (video or board), french bulldogs, exchange advice on being a parent or just would like to grab a drink or two in San Diego!
